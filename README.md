# Create React Express App

## Deployed Site:

## About
It's always tricky to know how much to tip, unless you're an arithmetic mastermind! This app 
* Takes in the value of the bill


* Takes in the desired tip percentage


* Includes the option to split the tip amount by number of people at the table

 

* Calculates the amount of tip per table (or per person if the split option is chosen) and return that value to the user.

## Technologies used
* React
* Javascript
* Bootstrap

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

## Deployment (Heroku)

To deploy, simply add and commit your changes, and push to Heroku. As is, the NPM scripts should take care of the rest.
